# Password-Generator
Random Password Generator


## Description 

This project is a CWRU Coding Bootcamp homework assignment. This goal of this assignment is to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they've selected by modifying starter code. The user story is that an employee with access to sensitive data wants to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria so that they can create a strong password that provides greater security.

The purpose of this homework assignment is to practice using the JavaScript skills that have been taught in the past week. The deployed assignment should not produce any errors in the console when inspecting it.

The acceptance criteria is as follows:
GIVEN I need a new, secure password,

WHEN I click the button to generate a password

THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria.

WHEN prompted for password criteria

THEN I select which criteria to include in the password.

WHEN prompted for the length of the password

THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters.

WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password

THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.

WHEN I answer each prompt

THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected.

WHEN all prompts are answered

THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria.

WHEN the password is generated

THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page.
